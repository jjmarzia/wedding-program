% \section*{\textsc{Ceremony}}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item \textsc{Welcome} (5 minutes, lengthiness optional)
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item {\it Paloma welcomes the guests}
%   \end{itemize}
% \item \textsc{Community Greeting} (3 minutes)
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item {\bf Paloma}: Matt and Alice  would not be here today without the support of their community  of family and friends - that's you! All of you are here today to give your love and support as part of the community that forms the foundation for a strong marriage. Matt and Alice want to thank you for joining us, and acknowledge those who couldn't be with us today but are also an integral part of that foundation. Please shake hands with the people around you, and give yourselves a pat on the back for all you've done to help them get where they are today. 
%   \end{itemize}

% \item \textsc{Reading 1}: {\bf Rich} (3 minutes)

%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item {\bf Paloma}: Now Alice's father, Rich, will read an excerpt from \underline{Corelli's Mandolin} by Louis de Berniere.

%   \item {\bf Rich}:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item ``Love is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake and then subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion. That is just being ``in love'' which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident. Your mother and I had it, we had roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossoms had fallen from our branches we found that we were one tree and not two.''
% \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% \item \textsc{Home brewing unity ceremony} (5-7 minutes)
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item [] {\bf Paloma}: Now Alice and Matt's brothers, Paul and Wade, will lead a brewing unity ceremony.
%   \item [I.] \textsc{Introduction}
%   {\bf Wade}: Matt and Alice love brewing beer as much as they love drinking it. From brewing beer together, they have learned to work as a team, to plan and solve problems together, to stick with a complicated task for hours on end, and to see each beer through hours of brewing, weeks of fermenting, and years of aging. Matt and Alice  will apply the same qualities of perseverance, patience, and cooperation to both the obstacles and the joyful times that will fill the years to come.
    
%   \item [II.] \textsc{Water}
%     {\bf Paul}: Water is the foundation of life on earth, and the foundation of any beer, just as love is the foundation of Matt and Alice's relationship. Matt, Alice - please add water to the brewing vessel.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textit{(Matt and Alice each pour in a little water)}
% \end{itemize}

    
%   \item [III.] \textsc{Barley}
%     {\bf Wade}: To that water, you add barley, which provides the sugar that will feed the yeast. Barley gives sustenance, just as Matt and Alice sustain each other, not just with delicious meals, but by supporting each other in all aspects of life. Their deep bond is sustained by  this unconditional support in all things. Add the barley to the brewing vessel.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textit{(Matt and Alice each pour in a little barley)}
% \end{itemize}

%   \item [IV.] \textsc{Fire}
%     {\bf Paul}: The heat from a flame breaks down the sugars from the barley. Just as the pot sometimes boils over, Matt and Alice will encounter turbulent times in the future, but they will continue to learn and grow together, and from those experiences, a stronger bond will be formed. Light the candle and place the glass over the heat.
%     \begin{itemize}
% \item \textit{(Matt \& Alice Light a candle in a jar with long matches or a long lighter, wave the glass of water \& barley over the flame briefly, blow out the candle)}
% \end{itemize}

%   \item [V.] \textsc{Hops}
%     {\bf Wade}: Originally, hops were added to beer to preserve it, so that it could be stored for great lengths of time in cellars or on ships. In more recent years, brewers have also begun to use hops for their floral flavors and aromas. These hops represent Matt and Alice's commitment to preserving their marriage over a lifetime, through long winters and choppy seas, but they are also a reminder to stop and smell the flowers, to take the time each day to appreciate each other. Smell the hops, and then add them to the brewing vessel.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textit{(M \& A each add some hops)}
% \end{itemize}

%   \item [VI.] \textsc{Yeast}
%     {\bf Paul}: In the final stage of the brewing process, yeast is added to the beer. This is the magic that turns sugar into alcohol, and turns wort into beer. Where before you had funky-smelling sugar water, after the yeast runs its course, you're left with  something tasty and intoxicating. When we talk about marriage, we often talk about the serious things, but Matt and Alice's relationship also relies on the joy and laughter they bring to each other. They will fill each other's days with merriment by never losing their love of fun and adventure. Last but not least, add the yeast to the brewing vessel.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textit{(M \& A each sprinkle some yeast)}
% \end{itemize}

    
%   \item [VII.] \textsc{Time}
%     {\bf Wade}: The final ingredient of brewing a beer is time. Matt and Alice are making a promise to spend the rest of their years together, knowing that their relationship will change, that they each will change as individuals, and that the world will change around them. Through it all, they will have each other. Matt and Alice, seal the jar.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textit{(Matt and Alice seal the jar)}
% \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}


% \item \textsc{Reading 2}: {\bf Kate} (3 minutes)

%   {\bf Paloma}: Now Matt's sister Kate will read an excerpt from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's ruling in the case of Goodridge \textit{vs.} the Department of Public Health. 

% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\bf Kate}:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Marriage is a vital social institution. The exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other nurtures love and mutual support; it brings stability to our society. For those who choose to marry, and for their children, marriage provides an abundance of legal, financial, and social benefits. In return it imposes weighty legal, financial, and social obligations.

% \item Without question, civil marriage enhances the ``welfare of the community.'' It is a ``social institution of the highest importance.''

% \item Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family. Because it fulfills yearnings for security, safe haven, and connection that express our common humanity, civil marriage is an esteemed institution, and the decision whether and whom to marry is among life's momentous acts of self-definition.
% \end{itemize}

% \end{itemize}

% \item \textsc{Expression of intent} (2 minutes)
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item {\bf Paloma}: Now we've arrived at the heart of the ceremony, the part where Matt and Alice make some promises to each other, and you make some promises to them.

%   \item {\bf Paloma}: Alice and Matt, do you freely and unreservedly offer yourselves to each other?

%   \item {\bf A+M}: We do.

%   \item {\bf Paloma}: Will you live together in faithfulness, joy, and mutual respect for the rest of your lives?

%   \item {\bf A+M}: We will.

%   \item {\bf Paloma}: Do you take each other to be your eternal partners in crime?

%   \item {\bf A+M}: We do.

%   \item {\bf Paloma}: \textit{(addressing audience)} Will all of you gathered uphold and honor Matt and Alice, and respect and celebrate their union? If so, say \textbf{``We will.''}

%   \item \textit{All}: We will.

%   \item \textbf{Paloma}: Will you stand by them in times of trouble, and celebrate with them in times of joy?

%   \item \textit{All}: We will. 
% \end{itemize}

% \item \textsc{Vows \& Ring exchange} (7 minutes)
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item {\bf Paloma}: Matt and Alice will  now read the vows that they wrote for each other.

%   \item {\bf Alice}: Vow vow vow vow vow

%   \item {\bf Matt}: Vow vow vow vow vow

%   \item {\bf Paloma}: Now it's time for you to seal the deal by giving each other rings. Think of these as magic rings that hold all the power of the promises and intentions in the vows you just said to each other. When you wear them, you are permanently encapsulated by love.

%   \item \textit{Anthony will have the rings in his pocket - Anthony comes forward and gives Matt's ring to Alice.}

%   \item {\bf Paloma}: Alice, repeat after me: \textbf{With this ring, I thee wed.}

%   \item {\bf Alice}: With this ring, I thee wed \textit{(put ring on Matt!)}

%   \item \textit{Anthony gives Alice's ring to Matt}

%   \item {\bf Paloma}: Matt, repeat after me: \textbf{With this ring, I thee wed.}

%   \item {\bf Matt}: With this ring, I thee wed \textit{(put ring on Alice!)}
% \end{itemize}

% \item \textsc{Pronouncement and kiss}
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item {\bf Paloma}: I now pronounce you husband and wife! You may kiss each other. 

%   \item \textit{Matt \& Alice kiss!}

%   \item \textit{Fabian plays guitar as wedding party leaves the stagey area} (5 minutes)

%   \item \textit{Matt \& Alice leave together first - go get a quick picture taken, sign our marriage license, and spend a couple minutes alone}

%   \item \textit{Wedding party leaves up the aisle in reverse order from how they arrived}

%   \item \textit{Fabian and Paloma leave last}
% \end{itemize}
% \end{enumerate}
